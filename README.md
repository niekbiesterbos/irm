# Variations in Language on Twitter
## General Information
Language is an essential part of human communication, and it varies significantly across cultures, regions, and social groups. This study aims to explore the variations in the use of the  word "voetbal wedstrijd" in Dutch tweets.

## Background Information
Several studies have analysed the use of words in social media platforms such as Twitter. For instance, [1] developed a convolutional neural network to detect offensive language in tweets, while [2] analysed and predicted the ratings of YouTube comments. These studies suggest that analysing the use of words can help us better understand how language shapes our online interactions. [3] examined the influence of the 2014 FIFA World Cup on Twitter communication. They analyzed tweets related to the event and found that global interest in soccer led to a substantial increase in Twitter activity, showcasing the signif- icance of soccer in shaping online conversations. [4] investigated the use of sentiment analysis to understand the emotions and opinions of soccer fans on Twitter. 

## Research Question and Hypothesis
**Research Question:** How does the use of the word "voetbal wedstrijd" vary in Dutch tweets based on the day of the week?

**Hypothesis:** Tweets that contain the word "voetbal wedstrijd" will be more frequent during the weekends than during the weekdays.

## Method
**Data Collection:** The dataset for this study will be collected using the Twitter API. The tweets will be collected in Dutch language, and the data collection process will focus on recent tweets from the last month. The data will be filtered to include only tweets that contain the word "voetbal wedstrijd."

**Sampling Method:** The sampling method used in this study will be random sampling. Random sampling will allow us to obtain a representative sample of tweets that contain the word "voetbal wedstrijd."

**Data Analysis:** The tweets collected will be pre-processed, including stripping, and removing retweets. A contingency table will be used to analyse the variations in the use of the word "cool" based on the day of the week.

The python module which executes the pre-processing can be found in data/main.py
