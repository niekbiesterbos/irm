# Variations in Language on Twitter
## General Information
Language is an essential part of human communication, and it varies significantly across cultures, regions, and social groups. This study aims to explore the variations in the use of the slang word "weddie" in Dutch tweets. “Weddie” is slang for “Wedstrijd”.

## Background Information
Several studies have analysed the use of slang words in social media platforms such as Twitter. For instance, [1] developed a convolutional neural network to detect offensive language in tweets, while [2] analysed and predicted the ratings of YouTube comments. These studies suggest that analysing the use of slang words can help us better understand how language shapes our online interactions.

## Research Question and Hypothesis
**Research Question:** How does the use of the slang word "weddie" vary in Dutch tweets based on the day of the week?

**Hypothesis:** Tweets that contain the slang word "weddie" will be more frequent during the weekends than during the weekdays.

## Method
**Data Collection:** The dataset for this study will be collected using the Twitter API. The tweets will be collected in Dutch language, and the data collection process will focus on recent tweets from the last month. The data will be filtered to include only tweets that contain the slang word "weddie."

**Sampling Method:** The sampling method used in this study will be random sampling. Random sampling will allow us to obtain a representative sample of tweets that contain the slang word "weddie."

**Data Analysis:** The tweets collected will be pre-processed, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming. A contingency table will be used to analyse the variations in the use of the slang word "cool" based on the day of the week.

## Contingency Table
| Day of the Week | Number of Tweets Containing "Weddie" |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Monday         |                                     |
| Tuesday        |                                     |
| Wednesday      |                                     |
| Thursday       |                                     |
| Friday         |                                     |
| Saturday       |                                     |
| Sunday         |                                     |


The table above will be used to analyse the frequency of tweets containing the slang word "weddie" based on the day of the week.
